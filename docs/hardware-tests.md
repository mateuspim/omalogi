# Hardware test log

Manual tests run on real hardware, in order. Each entry lists the device, what was
done, how it was checked independently of Omalogi, and the result. The raw device
dumps referenced here stay local (they contain the device Unit ID); the redacted
fixture in `tests/fixtures/g502x-c099.json` comes from the same dump.

Device for the 2026-09-13 entries: Logitech G502 X, wired, USB 046d:c099, firmware
U1 60.00.B0009, bootloader BL1 59.00.B0002, HID++ 4.2. Host: Arch Linux
(Omarchy 4.0.3, Hyprland 0.56.2).

The independent checker is `research/tools/probe_readonly.py`, a separate Python
implementation that only sends HID++ getters and `memoryRead`. It is pinned to
046d:c099, so entries for other mice rest on Omalogi's own read-back instead.

## 2026-09-29 — full self-test on the G502 X Lightspeed through its receiver (WPID 409f)

Device: Logitech G502 X Lightspeed, through its LIGHTSPEED receiver, WPID 409f,
firmware MPM 30.00.B0014. Onboard profile memory reports memory model 1, profile
format 3, 5 profiles and 11 buttons, so this entry is the one that moves layout (1, 3)
into `VERIFIED_LAYOUTS` and WPID 409f into the verified table. The wired G502 X
Lightspeed (046d:c098) stays untested: nothing here was checked over its cable.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| First `scripts/hardware-selftest.py` on profile 5, before #50 | 1976 checks passed, 1 failed: sector `0005` differed at six bytes, each `0xff` → `0x00` |
| Cause | the factory special actions are stored as `90 xx ff 00`; decoding dropped the `0xff` reserved byte and encoding wrote `0x00`. Fixed in #50 |
| `scripts/hardware-selftest.py` on profile 5, with #50 | 1466 checks passed, 0 failed, 87 s; start and end backups identical in every sector |
| Same, on profile 4 with profile 5 turned off | 1469 checks passed, 0 failed, 68 s, profile on/off checks included; start and end backups identical in every sector |
| Profile memory after each run | the test slot restored from the pre-run backup; a fresh backup byte-identical to the owner's original, all 9 saved sectors |
| Independent cross-check | none: `probe_readonly.py` only speaks 046d:c099 |

What the runs skipped, so the check count is not read as a difference in the mouse:

- default-layer slots 4 and 6–10 (DPI shift, scroll left and right, cycle profile, DPI up
  and down), whose factory bindings carry a `0xff` reserved byte (`90 xx ff 00`). They
  have no text form and stay verbatim, as on the G502 Hero. The G-Shift layer spells all
  11 slots.

Found along the way: turning on a profile placed **before** the active one moves the
mouse's current profile back by one position without loading it. Omalogi now selects
the profile in use again after such a write; see 2026-09-30 below. With profile 4 off and profile 5 active at 1600 DPI, `omalogi profiles enable 4`
made the mouse report profile 4 as active while the live DPI stayed 1600. Two presses of
the cycle-profile button then landed on profile 1 at 1000 DPI (4 → 5 → 1), so the
firmware's own current profile had moved. Turning profile 4 off and on with profile 3
active changed nothing. The first run with profile 4 off hit this in the self-test's
on/off step: 1467 checks passed, 2 failed ("profile 4 is in use", and the directory
sector left changed until the script's restore). The passing run above puts the turned-off
profile after the test profile.


Device: Logitech G502 Hero, wired, USB 046d:c08b, firmware U1 27.03.B0010, bootloader
BOT 81.00.B0002. Onboard profile memory reports memory model 1, profile format 2,
5 profiles and 11 buttons, so this entry is the one that moves layout (1, 2) in
`VERIFIED_LAYOUTS` and 046d:c08b into the verified table.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `omalogi info` | U1 27.03.B0010 (active), BOT 81.00.B0002; DPI 1000, sensor range 100–25600; 125/250/500/1000 Hz; onboard mode |
| `scripts/hardware-selftest.py` on spare profile 5 (named `Omalogi Test` for the run) | 1463 checks passed, 0 failed, 54 s |
| Profile memory after the run | fresh backup byte-identical to the pre-run backup, all 12 saved sectors, 0 diffs |
| Independent cross-check | none: `probe_readonly.py` only speaks 046d:c099 |

What the run skipped, so the check count (1463 here, 1979 on the G502 X) is not read as a
difference in the mouse — the two are different hardware with different snapshots, and the
Hero's factory slots hold bindings the text catalog cannot spell:

- default-layer slots 5–10, whose factory bindings carry a `0xff` profile byte
  (`90 xx ff ff`); the G502 X stores `90 xx 00 00` and skips nothing. The G-Shift layer of
  the same profiles spells all 11 slots, so nothing is skipped there.
- the live DPI-switch check: every profile that reached it has a single DPI stage, so
  there is no other stage to switch the default to.
- the profile on/off toggle checks: all five profiles are enabled on this mouse.

The overlay leaves a slot alone unless it is edited, and so does the self-test now.

## 2026-09-13 — read path

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `omalogi info` firmware, DPI range, report rates | U1 60.00.B0009; 100–25600 step 50; 125/250/500/1000 Hz; matches Solaar's c099 dump |
| `omalogi backup` vs probe dump | all 9 sectors byte-identical |
| Active profile index | 1-based; confirmed by holding DPI shift (1600 → 800 DPI only on the DPI-shift profile) |
| Coexistence with OpenLogi 0.8.3 agent | 30 Omalogi commands while the agent held the device: 0 failures, backups identical |

## 2026-09-13 — profile switching (RAM only)

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `omalogi profiles activate 1` | probe reports profile 1 |
| `omalogi profiles activate 2` (restore) | probe reports profile 2 |
| Activate disabled profile 3 / missing profile 9 | refused with a message, nothing sent |
| Daemon: config `default_profile` 2 → 1 → 2 | switched within one poll; probe confirmed each; broken config reported, last good rules kept; clean SIGTERM exit, state file removed |

## 2026-09-13 — first onboard memory write, on a disabled profile

Procedure (profile 3 is disabled on this mouse, so it is never active):

1. Baseline: `omalogi backup`; all sectors equal the original probe dump.
2. `omalogi profiles edit 3 --rate 500 --dry-run` shows `Report rate 1000 Hz → 500 Hz`.
3. `omalogi profiles edit 3 --rate 500`: exit 0, automatic backup saved first.
4. Probe reads sector `0003` directly: report-rate byte `2` (500 Hz), CRC valid.
5. Fresh backup: only sector `0003` differs from the original, only at bytes 0, 253, 254
   (the report rate and the CRC).
6. `omalogi restore <automatic backup>`: "Restored and verified sectors 0003", with a
   backup of the pre-restore state saved first.
7. Final backup: all 9 sectors byte-identical to the original probe dump; probe reads
   sector `0003` equal to the original; active profile still 2; daemon service active.

Result: **pass**. Writes, read-back verification, automatic backups and restore work on
real hardware, and an edit changes exactly the intended bytes.

## 2026-09-13 — memory write to an enabled profile, applied by switching

Procedure (profile 1 is enabled but not active; profile 2 is active):

1. Baseline backup equals the original probe dump; live DPI 1600.
2. `omalogi profiles edit 1 --dpi 400,800,1600,3200 --default-dpi 400 --dry-run` shows
   `800 1200 [1600] 2400 3200 shift 800 → [400] 800 1600 3200 shift 800` (shift keeps
   its 800 DPI value at its new position).
3. Real write: exit 0, automatic backup saved first.
4. Probe reads sector `0001`: stages 400/800/1600/3200/unused, default index 0, shift
   index 1, CRC valid. Only sector `0001` changed (bytes 1–6, 9–12, CRC).
5. `omalogi profiles activate 1`: live DPI (probe, `getSensorDpi`) reads **400** — the
   device applies a stored profile's settings when it is selected.
6. `omalogi profiles activate 2`: live DPI back to 1600.
7. `omalogi restore <automatic backup>`: sector `0001` restored and verified; all 9
   sectors byte-identical to the original dump; profile 2 active at 1600 DPI.

Result: **pass**.

## 2026-09-13 — device lock between the CLI and the daemon

With the daemon running as a user service, a separate process held
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/omalogi/device.lock` (as `profiles edit` and `restore` do) and the
active profile was switched to 1 underneath it:

| Step | Daemon state |
|---|---|
| Lock held, 7 seconds (two poll intervals) | stayed at profile 2 every second: polls skipped |
| Lock released | profile 1 within one poll |
| `omalogi profiles activate 2` | profile 2 |

Result: **pass**. The daemon does not touch the device while a memory write holds the lock.

## 2026-09-13 — udev rule

`packaging/udev/70-omalogi.rules` installed to `/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/`, rules reloaded,
hidraw change event triggered, mouse not replugged:

| Node | USB interface | Tags |
|---|---|---|
| hidraw7 | 00 (mouse input) | `:seat:` |
| hidraw8 | 01 (HID++) | `:seat:uaccess:` |

`omalogi info` opened hidraw8. Result: **pass** for matching: only the HID++ interface is
tagged. The session ACL on hidraw8 was already present from an earlier manual `setfacl`,
so access coming from the rule alone is confirmed after the next replug.

## 2026-09-13 — mouse picture and button positions

`omalogi picture` downloaded `metadata.json`, `front.png` and `side.png` for depot `g502x`
(matched on product id c099) from assets.openlogi.org in 1.4 s; each file matched the
size and SHA-256 in the host's index. A second run with `--offline` used the cache only.

The metadata names buttons `g502x_g<N>_m1`. With markers drawn on the renders, each
position was compared with the firmware's default binding for slot N−1 on this mouse:

| Id | Position on the render | Slot N−1 default |
|---|---|---|
| g1, g2, g3 | left button, right button, wheel | left, right, middle click |
| g4 | rear thumb button | back |
| g5 | front thumb button | DPI shift |
| g6 | middle thumb button | forward |
| g7, g8 | wheel tilt left, right | scroll left, scroll right |
| g9 | button below the wheel | cycle profile |
| g10, g11 | upper and lower left-edge buttons | DPI up, DPI down |

All 11 agree, so the overlay maps g*N* to slot N−1 for the G502 X only. `scroll1` and
`scroll2` mark wheel up and down, which have no slot. Result: **consistent**; a physical
press per button has not been done.

## 2026-09-13 — when written profile memory reaches the mouse

Reported problem: DPI edits made in the overlay could not be felt. The two writes had
gone to profile 2 while profile 1 was active. Tested on profile 2, watching the live
sensor DPI (`omalogi info`):

| Step | Live DPI |
|---|---|
| Profile 2 active (default stage 1600) | 1600 |
| Write default stage 2400 to profile 2 | 1600 |
| One second later | 1600 |
| `setCurrentProfile` to profile 2 again (already active) | 1600 |
| Switch to profile 1, then back to profile 2 | **2400** |

Result: the firmware loads a profile's settings only when it switches to that profile.
A write, or selecting the profile that is already active, is not enough. Profile 2 was
restored from the write's backup afterwards.

Fix: after a verified write or restore that changes the active profile, Omalogi switches
to another enabled profile and straight back (under the device lock) and reports
`takes_effect`. Verified with the release build:

| Case | Reported | Live DPI |
|---|---|---|
| Edit profile 2 while profile 1 is active | `when_activated` | 1600, unchanged |
| Edit profile 2 while it is active | `now` | 2400 immediately, profile 2 still active |
| Restore profile 2 from that backup | `now` | 1600 |

Result: **pass**. Profile 1 was active again at the end, and profile 2 was byte-identical
to its state before the tests.

## 2026-09-13 — responsiveness, live DPI and concurrent access

**Live DPI.** `setSensorDpi` (0x2201 function 3) in onboard mode returned a HID++ feature
error and the live DPI stayed unchanged, so a DPI preview without writing a profile is
not possible while the mouse runs onboard profiles.

**Latency.** Measured on the release build, profile 2, everything undone afterwards:

| Step | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Overlay save of the profile in use | ~1.26 s (preview, edit, full reread) | 316–325 ms via `omalogi serve` |
| First save of a session (includes the full backup) | — | 693 ms |
| Undo on the profile in use | — | 414 ms |
| Activate a profile | ~0.3 s process start | 76 ms |

Gains came from one long-lived session, building the result from the verified bytes
instead of reading the profile again, and switching profiles during a reload without
reading the directory each time.

**Concurrent access.** Two Omalogi processes talking to the mouse at the same moment are
not safe:

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| 10 `omalogi serve` starts, each racing a CLI read | 6 took 5.5 s (a request timed out) |
| 10 starts alone, daemon polling | all ~325 ms |
| A `state` read overlapping other processes' memory reads | the directory came back with an invalid checksum |

Fix: every process holds the device lock for all of its traffic (CLI per command, the
server per request, the daemon per poll, as before), and profile data that fails its
checksum is read once more and otherwise refused, never edited or written back.

Stress test after the fix: a loop reading all profiles continuously, 10 server starts
racing CLI reads, and the full save and undo sequence at the same time.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Loop reads | 40 of 40 ok, every checksum valid |
| Server starts | 10 of 10 ok (~0.92 s, waiting for the lock; no timeouts) |
| Saves and undos under load | all ok; profile 2 byte-identical afterwards |

Result: **pass**.

## Full self-test through the overlay's server

2026-09-14, G502 X (wired), firmware U1 60.00.B0009. Profile 3 was turned on with
`omalogi profiles enable 3` and named with `profiles edit 3 --name "Omalogi Test"`
(both verified by reading back), then `scripts/hardware-selftest.py` drove
`omalogi serve` exactly as the overlay does:

| Area | What was checked |
|---|---|
| Bindings | 43 actions (the catalog, 16 key combinations, `button:6`, `button:16`) rotated through all 11 buttons on both layers: every action on every slot, each read back with a label; a fresh read every 10 writes |
| Refusals | 20 bad edits (unknown actions and keys, `button:0`/`17`, slot 16, DPI 50/30000/123, six stages, a default that is not a stage, 333 Hz, long or non-ASCII names, profile 9) wrote nothing |
| Sensitivity | 1 to 5 stages from 100 to 25600 DPI, each stage as default with another as shift, all four report rates |
| Names | set, 47 characters, cleared |
| Undo | three writes undone one by one, each matching the state before it |
| In use | activation; a new default DPI and report rate live at once (`takes_effect: now`); undo live at once; the profile in use and a profile already off refused; profile 4 turned on and off |
| Restore | all profile memory byte for byte as before the test |

A first run found 10 failures, all in the script (unused DPI stages read back as `null`).
The second run: **1979 checks passed, 0 failed, in 30 s**.

| Request | Count | Median | Max |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apply` | 87 | 269 ms | 686 ms (the first, with the backup) |
| `undo` | 6 | 390 ms | 422 ms |
| `state` | 13 | 375 ms | 386 ms |
| `activate` | 4 | 66 ms | 76 ms |
| `set_enabled` | 5 | 52 ms | 578 ms |

Noted, not failures: slot 11 is refused as "not a button on this mouse", and unsorted
stages such as 1600,800 are kept in that order (the overlay always sorts them).

Result: **pass**.

## 2026-09-17: a profile directory that fails its checksum (#16)

Reproduced the damage reported in #16 and recovered from it with the release build. The
daemon was stopped for the test and started again afterwards. A scratch script, holding
the device lock, wrote sector `0000` with its entries unchanged, byte 22 set to `0x01`
and the checksum `ffff`, only after checking that the sector matched a fresh backup.

`memoryWriteEnd` answered with HID++ error `0x04`, yet the bytes were stored: a fresh
backup showed sector `0000` differing from the original at bytes 22, 253 and 254 only,
and every other sector identical. The firmware checks the checksum when a write ends
but keeps a sector that fails it, so a writer that ignores that error leaves exactly
this state, as does an interrupted write.

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| `omalogi profiles`, `profiles edit 3 --rate 500 --dry-run` | refused, naming `omalogi profiles repair` |
| `omalogi backup` | 9 sectors saved, `0000` flagged in `invalid_checksums`, with a warning |
| `omalogi profiles repair --dry-run` | listed profiles 1–3 on, 4–5 off; nothing written |
| `omalogi profiles repair` | backup saved first; directory rewritten and verified |
| Fresh backup | all 9 sectors byte-identical to the original, none flagged |
| Damage again, `omalogi restore <original> --dry-run` | would write sector `0000` only |
| `omalogi restore <original>` | restored and verified; the pre-restore backup flags `0000` |
| `omalogi restore <pre-restore backup> --dry-run` | refused: sector `0000` was saved with an invalid checksum |
| Final backup | all 9 sectors byte-identical to the original |

Result: **pass**. The mouse ended exactly as it started, and the daemon was running again.
The overlay's Repair card was checked with the model tests only.

## 2026-09-21: OpenLogi 0.8.6

OpenLogi 0.8.6 reworks how `openlogi-hidpp` matches replies to requests: a reply that
arrives after its request timed out is now held back for up to a second and discarded,
instead of being taken as the answer to the next request with the same header. Every
read and write Omalogi makes goes through that code, so the upgrade was checked on the
G502 X before merging, with the daemon running.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `backup`, `--json info`, `--json profiles` with the 0.8.3 helper and the 0.8.6 build | identical: all 9 sectors, device info and every profile |
| `scripts/hardware-selftest.py --profile 3` | 1979 checks passed, 0 failed, in 30 s; `apply` median 271 ms, as before |
| Fresh backup after the self-test | all 9 sectors byte-identical to the backup before it |

Result: **pass**.

## 2026-09-30: turning a profile on or off keeps the profile in use

Following the G502 X Lightspeed finding above, reproduced on the wired G502 X (U1
60.00.B0009) with the daemon running and no rules configured, so nothing else switched
profiles. Profile defaults: 1 at 2100 DPI, 2 at 800, 3 at 1600, so the live DPI shows
which profile the mouse is running. Profile 3 in use, profile 1 placed before it.

| Step | Before the fix | With the fix |
|---|---|---|
| `profiles activate 3` | reports 3, live 1600 | reports 3, live 1600 |
| `profiles disable 1` | reports **2**, live 1600: still running profile 3 | reports 3, live 1600 |
| `profiles enable 1` | reports **1**, live **2100**: switched to profile 1 | reports 3, live 1600 |

The G502 X and the Lightspeed move their current profile by different rules, so the fix
does not predict the rule: `set_profile_enabled` reads the current profile before and
after the directory write and, if it moved, selects the profile in use again, which the
firmware loads. The emulated device gained a switch that names the outcome, and a test
that fails without the fix.

Each run started from a backup and ended with profile 2 in use at 800 DPI and all 9
sectors byte-identical to it.

Result: **pass**.

## 2026-09-30: G502 X Lightspeed mouse picture and button positions

Device: the G502 X Lightspeed of the 2026-09-29 self-test, through its receiver.
`omalogi picture` uses depot `g502x_lightspeed`, whose metadata names buttons
`g502x-lightspeed_g<N>_m1`, with a hyphen where the depot has an underscore. With
markers drawn on the renders, each position was compared with the firmware's default
binding for slot N−1 on this mouse, and with the name Logitech's quick-start guide
prints for that button:

| Id | Position on the render | Logitech's name | Slot N−1 default |
|---|---|---|---|
| g1, g2, g3 | left button, right button, wheel | G1, G2, G3 | left, right, middle click |
| g4 | rear thumb button | G4 | back |
| g5 | front thumb button | G6 | DPI shift |
| g6 | middle thumb button | G5 | forward |
| g7, g8 | wheel tilt left, right | G10, G11 | scroll left, scroll right |
| g9 | lower button behind the wheel | G9 | cycle profile |
| g10, g11 | upper and lower left-edge buttons | G8, G7 | DPI up, DPI down |

All 11 agree, so the overlay maps g*N* to slot N−1 for the Lightspeed too. The ids are
not the names printed on the mouse, so the overlay labels each button with Logitech's
name from this table; it used to show G*N*, which named six of the G502 X family's
buttons wrongly (the sniper button read G5). `scroll1` and `scroll2` mark wheel up and down (Logitech's G12, G13), which
have no slot; the button above G9 switches the wheel mode mechanically and has no
marker.

Actions assigned through the markers took effect on the matching physical button: g4,
the rear thumb button, did DPI up and then a volume key. The edits were undone, and a
backup afterwards was byte-identical, in all 9 sectors, to the one taken before them.

Result: **consistent**.

## Observations

- 2026-09-16: during the in-use phase of the self-test, one `omalogi dpi` read right after
  a profile reload failed with `ETIMEDOUT` (os error 110) on the G502 X. The run stopped,
  its automatic restore put all profile memory back byte for byte (confirmed with a fresh
  backup), and the daemon logged nothing. The self-test now retries live-DPI reads twice,
  0.5 s apart, and picks its DPI cases from each sensor's own supported values; the next
  full run passed.

- 2026-09-13 20:00:34: one daemon poll failed with `ETIMEDOUT` (os error 110) from the
  hidraw write, with no other Omalogi traffic; the daemon reconnected at once. USB
  autosuspend is off for the mouse (`power/control` = `on`, never suspended). Cause
  unknown. Follow-up: a cross-process device lock around memory writes, and the daemon
  tolerates a single transient timeout.

## Not yet tested on hardware

- The rollback path after a failed verification (tested on the emulated device only).
- Unplugging the mouse during a write.
- A write started from the overlay editor (preview and rendering are tested).
- Device access through the udev rule alone, after a replug.
